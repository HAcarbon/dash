Topic: Addressing Ed Harris comments from email

1. Maybe this dataset would be a good test case to use to set up a github for to learn/practise version control 

		Github - work in progress - ML shall work on setting up 

2. Still need to fix the a) source id and b) farm sum total for 2020 – also add explanation of this fix somewhere in the dictionary
		a. Require clarification on what is meant by 'source id'
		b. short-term solution - just use the summed data numbers for now due to time crunch? 
					 - Or could exlcude for now until updated?

3. The remark I made about inconsistent or missing information for some of the rows… 
 	Different people completed the reports so difficult to know exaclty what could be causing this issue
	Rapeseed and feed wheat on pdf report output, but no data coming out for some crops etc in the results csv export despite being in the inputs - potential agrecalc issue
			- Can we contact Agrecalc to ask what might have happened?
			- Nothing on update section on site https://app.agrecalc.com/updates.php 
			- requires further investigation

4. As I look down the list of lineitem_code values, I see some thing I suspect are actually present in the farm operation (like field bean/field peas).  Am I missing something where this is accounted for elsewhere? Or is it possible a decision was made to do our best on the animal, machines, and grazing and the arable was less important and left off (thinking here of the Omnia data)? 
		- If not included in carbon calcuation, it was done as these crops/line item codes were/are part of the trials and have no commercial value


Other business: 
- Do we have access to the results of the survey which asked students and lecturers the kind of data they would like to see?
- Presently have a lot of data, so being able to specify specifically the data required would be helpful initially. 
- Dairy cow fertility data - cow manager, uniform 
	- need clarification on the actual data that is needed
	- need to figure out the data format that data can be exported in
		- can definitely be exported as a pdf - may need to scrape data if no other export function is available.
