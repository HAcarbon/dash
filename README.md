## Harper Adams carbon data

This project used the [Agrecalc](https://www.agrecalc.com/) carbon calculator to calculate the carbon footprint for the Harper Adams farm ([Future Farm](https://futurefarm.zone/)). The data includes 'whole farm' calculations, and calclations for individual livestock groups and crop types. Currently we have included the carbon results for the years 2020, 2021 and 2022.
