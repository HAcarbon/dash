## Harper Adams carbon data

Harper Adams University (HAU) is home to the [Harper Adams Future Farm](https://futurefarm.zone/). The main motivation for the development of the future farm was to demonstrate **sustainable** farming systems and have **unified strategic aims** for teaching and research.   

As part of the sustainable goals, the Future Farm aims to be **'net-zero'** for Scope 1 and Scope 2 by **2030**. The collection of data is pivotal to reaching this goal and to track progress over time. This project used the [Agrecalc](https://www.agrecalc.com/) carbon calculator to calculate the carbon footprint for the HAU Future Farm. The data includes 'whole farm' calculations, and calclations for individual livestock groups and crop types. Currently we have included the carbon results for the years 2020, 2021 and 2022. 
Data was collated from a range of software and systems across the Future Farm. This data was collated and inputted into the Agrecalc Farm Carbon Calculator. Separate reports and '.csv' results were calculated and exported for 2020, 2021 and 2022. This is the beginning of annual carbon data collection to allow for comparisions and tracking of carbon emissions (CO<sub>2</sub>e/kg) from the commercial farm operations. Results were formatted into a tidy format before being combined into a single dataframe.
